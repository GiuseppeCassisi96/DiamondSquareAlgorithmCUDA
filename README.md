# DiamondSquareAlgorithmCUDA
I developed a C++ application that uses the Diamond-Square algorithm to create heightmaps
procedurally. I used the CUDA API to execute the algorithm on the GPU. I developed two versions of the
algorithm: a sequential one that runs on the CPU and a parallel one that runs on the GPU. I compared
the two versions to measure the speedup obtained by the parallel one compared to the sequential
one.
